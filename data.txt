 Here's a quick micro-tutorial to get you started with some of the fun stuff it provides:

Type imp then tab to get import then type nu and tab to see which modules you can import that start with 'nu'.
Import numpy and type numpy? to get the full documentation for the numpy module. q exits the documentation view.
Try %time numpy.random.rand(1000, 1000).max()
to see how long it takes to calculate the maximum of a million numbers.
Type a = 15 and return. Note down the line number (it's in the square brackets in front of the line).
Now type %save set_a.py line number to save that line to a file. To find out more about the save magic function, you can type %save?
Change the value of a: a = 37
Use %run set_a.py to get the old value of a back. Just typing a at the prompt will display its value.
%edit set_a.py will open vi to edit the file. If you're a vi user, you can edit to your heart's content. Otherwise, just type :q to exit and return to IPython.
